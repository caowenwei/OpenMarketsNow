# OpenMarketsNow
OpenMarketsNow is a simple tool to check capital market status around the globe. I developed it because when I started learning to trade, I couldn't find a single place online to tell me which exchanges are currently in session and how the markets perform. 

The site is built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Its main dependencies are [DataTables](https://www.datatables.net/) and [Yahoo Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/).


#### ToDo
1. More exchanges and index data
2. Holidays
3. More complex trading hour formats (e.g. CME)
